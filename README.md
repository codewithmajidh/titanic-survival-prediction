# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a machine learning model. The dataset used is publicly available from [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about the passengers on board the Titanic, such as age, sex, ticket fare, and class. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## 🔧 Features of the Project

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and fixing inconsistent data.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature scaling
  - Feature engineering
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing distributions and correlations using plots
  - Understanding survival patterns across passenger groups
- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - Applied models using **Scikit-learn**
  - Model training and evaluation
